        <p>
          My names are Oke Olamide Oluwatimileyin, I'm a graduate of the Federal
          University of Agriculture Abeokuta Nigeria. I currently reside in Camp
          Alabata road, in the city of Abeokuta, Ogun state, I am 25 years Old
          and a decent Yoruba boy from Ilora, AFIJO local government OYO state,
          Nigeria. <br />
          I was born and brought up in Ojota, Lagos state. before moving down to
          Ogijo city in Ogun state where i spent most of my teenage and early
          youth life.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm currently enrolled into the esteemed AltSchool Africa school of
          Technology KARAKATU "24 set, where i'm studying to become a certified
          Backend engineer.<br />
          My ALTSCHOOL ID: <b>ALT/SOE/024/0283</b> <br />

        <p id="reasons">
          I've always been interested in technology and I've always dreamt of
          becoming a successful backend developer. I've studied various
          programming languages, frameworks and databases before starting my
          journey at AltSchool Africa. I've always been fascinated by the idea
          of creating something that helps people and solve problems. I've also
          always been passionate about the challenges I face in my career. I've
          always been driven and always have a strong desire to learn and grow.
          <br />
          I've always believed that I'm capable of doing great work, especially
          when I'm working on projects that help people and solve problems. I've
          always been a determined and ambitious person. <br />
          I've always had a good sense of humor and I've always enjoyed learning
          new things and trying out new experiences. I've always been a team
          player and I've always worked well in a team environment. <br />
          I've always been a good listener I joined AltSchool Africa because
          prior to being informed about their program, i've been in a tutorial
          cirlce going around and picking any tutorial videos i could get off
          the internet and struggle a lot with the consistency of seeing most
          courses through due to inferiority complex or seeing another course i
          feel might be a better one to learn or a perequisite to learing the
          one i started.<br />
          I was so enthusiastic to join AltSchool Africa when i heard about it
          because i believe thier program aligns with my vision in helping me to
          learn all the skills i need to grow and build a tech career i desire.
          Also it serves as a great opportunity to be among a good and
          progressive tech ecosystem that i can grow gradually in a directed
          track and a progressive Journey <br />
          <p id="myGoals">
            My goal at the end of this programme is that it helps solidifies my
            dream of being an outstanding Backend engineer an opens me to greater
            opportunites
