                <h4>REASONS</h4>
                  <p>
                    I've always been interested in technology and I've always dreamt of
                    becoming a successful backend developer. I've studied various
                    programming languages, frameworks and databases before starting my
                    journey at AltSchool Africa. I've always been fascinated by the idea
                    of creating something that helps people and solve problems. I've also
                    always been passionate about the challenges I face in my career. I've
                    always been driven and always have a strong desire to learn and grow.
                    I've always believed that I'm capable of doing great work, especially
                    when I'm working on projects that help people and solve problems. I've
                    always been a determined and ambitious person.
                    I've always had a good sense of humor and I've always enjoyed learning
                    new things and trying out new experiences. I've always been a team
                    player and I've always worked well in a team environment. <br /> <br>
                    I've always been a good listener I joined AltSchool Africa because
                    prior to being informed about their program, i've been in a tutorial
                    cirlce going around and picking any tutorial videos i could get off
                    the internet and struggle a lot with the consistency of seeing most
                    courses through due to inferiority complex or seeing another course i
                    feel might be a better one to learn or a perequisite to learing the
                    one i started.
                    I was so enthusiastic to join AltSchool Africa when i heard about it
                    because i believe thier program aligns with my vision in helping me to
                    learn all the skills i need to grow and build a tech career i desire.
                    Also it serves as a great opportunity to be among a good and
                    progressive tech ecosystem that i can grow gradually in a directed
                    track and a progressive Journey <br />

                      <h4>My Goals</h4>
                      <p>
                        My goal at the end of this programme is that it helps solidifies my
                        dream of being an outstanding Backend engineer an opens me to greater
